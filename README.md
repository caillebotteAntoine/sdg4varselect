# SDG4varselect: Stochastic Proximal Descent Gradient for variable selection

`sdg4varselect` is a Python package designed for **estimation and variable selection** in mixed-effect and joint causal models in high-dimensional settings using **stochastic gradient descent**.
It provides efficient tools for model selection when the number of parameters exceeds the number of observations, with a focus on interpretability and scalability.
